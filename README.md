# Hello all, this is Victor

## About me 

I am MSc candidate at the Condensed Matter Institute in the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Brazil. I'm currently working on numerical simulations for noncrystalline topological insulators.

During my BSc I found out that I really programming, the fact that I could type some commands on the computer and it would do all the hard work for me made me wonder how far I could go with that. Unfortunately during my BSc I actually didn't need to use programming as much as I wish. I used C, Python and Mathematica for mostly graphical plotting and solving differential equations and during a term I had to upgrade some equipments in the Condensed Matter laboratory, but that was about it.

I chose a MSc that was mostly programming and have been working on it for nearly two years. In the past few months I've had more free time and started dedicating it to upgrading my programming skills.



### Academic Interests

As a physicist I am very interested in pretty much all physics related. Photonics, quantum information, spintronics, semiconductors, 2D materials and so on.

But not only that, I also quite interested in experimental physics and direct industry applications. I have taken experimental schools and workshops prior to the pandemic and they had me leaning towards pursing an experimental PhD.

As a programmer I am interest (again) in all code-related. I am currently studying Machine Learning and Deep learning but also have on queue: SQL, Web Development (CSS, NodeJS etc), Docker, Kubernetes, Django, C++ and much more. And working with software development or something outside of the academic enviroment is also a possibility for me. 

I enjoy thinking and problem-solving in general be it as an academic or not.

## My Repositories

So far I only have these repos because I only upload to Github when my projects reach a minimum level of functionality and organization.

### Amorphization

A repository with the codes that I use for my thesis. I still haven't uploaded all the code to it, but will do in the coming months.

### Simulation

This is a fairly simple (and outdated) text-based simulation game I am implementing to practice some aspects of Python and to use some packages. In the near future I will also add ML to it so it automatically balances itself.

## Upcoming Repositories

[ ] Molecular Dynamics Simulation (already started)
[ ] Finite Element Method Simulation (already started)
[ ] Ising Model and variants
[ ] Machine Learning-based predictor 
[ ] As soon as I take the Web Dev course I already have several websites projects
